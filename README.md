# üìç Public Transit Visualizer
This Streamlit app simulates a real-time tracking system for public transport using the SIRI-SM protocol. It displays live vehicle positions on a municipal map, allows filtering by time, line, speed, or operator, and supports tracing individual vehicle routes. The bundled demo SQLite database contains 1,000,000 records ingested from SIRI API responses collected on June 18, 2025.
